**Problem Statement**

The clustering model aims to group transaction data to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and potentially flag fraudulent activities. Objectives include segmenting customers based on spending behavior, analyzing merchants, and identifying geographic or behavioral irregularities. This helps banks enhance fraud detection, personalize services, and improve risk management using transaction data insights.



**Data Description**

The dataset contains transaction records, including details like transaction amount, merchant, category, location, and timestamps, as well as customer demographics (age, gender, job) to analyze and identify fraudulent activities.

- Unnamed: 0: An index column, likely redundant for analysis.
- trans_date_trans_time: Timestamp indicating the date and time of the transaction.
- cc_num: The credit card number associated with the transaction.
- merchant: Name of the merchant or store where the transaction occurred. Fraudulent merchants are prefixed with "fraud".
